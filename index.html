                                    IQ Option (IQ Broker) was founded quite recently, but even
                                    in the few years of its operation, it has managed to develop
                                    into one of the biggest binary options brokerage companies
                                    in Europe. The main factor that has influenced such rapid
                                    growth is the combination of high-quality services and a
                                    democratic approach. IQ Option (IQ Broker) has made trading
                                    available to the masses, while, at the same time, the
                                    company has invested a lot into the quality of their
                                    platform, help and support service, and also offers a
                                    variety of trading tools. Within the EU IQOption.com is
                                    regulated by CySec (license number 247/14) and follows the
                                    norms of MiFID.

                                        IQ Option offers some of the best trading conditions as
                                        compared to other binary options brokers on the European
                                        market. The minimum deposit threshold is $10, while the
                                        minimum bid can be as low as $1. It also offers numerous
                                        ways of money depositing/withdrawal which includes a
                                        variety of payment systems.

                                        Clients are offered two types of trading instruments,
                                        which can be differentiated by their expiration date.
                                        Classical binary options have their expiration dates
                                        varying between 15 and 60 minutes, while ‘turbo’ options
                                        will last between one and three minutes. Short term
                                        options will allow you to vary your trading strategy and
                                        also catch the moments of high volatility, profiting from
                                        short-term market fluctuations.

                                        metals. Such a wide selection covers most classes of
                                        financial assets and provides traders with an opportunity
                                        to select trading strategies to meet their personal

                                        hope that in the future, the company will continue adding
                                        to the existing selections, as at the moment the number of

                                        IQ options trading platform works equally well on PCs and
                                        mobile devices. Its interface is based on dynamic graphs,
                                        which show the development of asset prices in real time.
                                        One of the main differences between the IQ Option platform
                                        and those of most other binary brokers is the set of extra
                                        functions, such as zoom in/out on different parts of the
                                        chart, drawing lines, curves, and other figures on the
                                        graphs. The side panel on the left can be set up to
                                        display trading history, live leader boards, news feeds,
                                        or even educational materials.

                                        IQ Option trading app for tablets and smartphones is
                                        definitely worth a mention. It allows you to stay ‘in the
                                        market’ even when you are not at work. This mobile
                                        platform is almost as functional as its full version, the
                                        only difference lies in the layout and the size of
                                        separate elements of the interface. This platform is
                                        available to Android and iOS users and is downloadable for
                                        free from Google Play and the App Store.

                                        A free demo account becomes available as soon as you have
                                        created your personal account and gives you access to a
                                        virtual case of $1000. It allows you to perform all types
                                        of trades that are available for users with real accounts.
                                        This allows traders to test their trading strategies and
                                        get used to the platform without having to deposit any
                                        money. It is worth noting that the company has recently
                                        introduced a possibility to top up demo accounts, which
                                        means that if you lose all the virtual money, you will be
                                        able to add more virtual money. In any case, it is
                                        advisable to test one’s strategies using very small sums
                                        of money ($1-5 per trade) to get the real flavour of the
                                        market as soon as possible.

                                        personal manager, and faster funds withdrawal (within 24

                                        Any demo account can easily be turned into a real one by
                                        depositing some money. In this case the virtual sum on
                                        your account will disappear and your balance will equal
                                        your deposit. In order to open a real account, you need to
                                        click on the green button in the top right corner of the
                                        broker’s homepage, or by clicking on the same area in the
                                        top right corner of the demo account trading interface.
                                        The process consists of two stages – creating an account
                                        (skip if you already have a demo one) and depositing
                                        money. The first step can also be done using your
                                        Facebook, Google+, or Gmail accounts. Money can be
                                        deposited through a bank card (Visa, MasterCard) or
                                        through some of the most popular digital payment systems.

                                        for deposits. To initialise withdrawal, one needs to apply
                                        from the account area, providing one’s personal
                                        information and the preferred means of withdrawal.
                                        Applications usually take up to three working days to
                                        process; and during this time the company may request
                                        additional documents to secure the transaction. These may
                                        include a scan of an ID document, for instance. The status
                                        of your application can be traced in your personal space
                                        on your account.

                                        IQ Option is a ‘universal’ broker that has made trading
                                        convenient and accessible. The traders latter will
                                        appreciate the perks of the VIP accounts, as well as the
                                        sets of functions to help customize the graphs, as well as
                                        quite usable mobile applications. However, the slightly
                                        limited selection of core assets may also limit the choice
                                        of one’s trading strategy. Traders will gain the most from
                                        using this platform - the minimum deposit threshold is
                                        low, and there is a fully functional demo account (which
                                        is quite a rarity among binary options brokers), as well
                                        as a user-friendly and flexible platform with lots of
                                        learning materials.
